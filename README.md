# Modeling-The-Living-Cell
Work Completed In Modeling The Living Cell for Spring 2021
Here I am publishing the various models and algorithm implementations we do in homework so that I may refer back to them at a later date. 

### PS1: MATLAB REVIEW

### PS2: MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO SAMPLING OF LENNARD-JONES POTENTIAL

### PS3: DETERMINISTIC AND STOCHASTIC SOLUTIONS TO ODEs
> Implemented the Gillespie Algorithm for approximating chemcical kinetics and learned to use MATLAB's built in ODE45 solver.
